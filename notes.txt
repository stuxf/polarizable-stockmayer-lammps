Next Steps:

Seems like params might be off;

Set thermostatted reduced temperature to be ~= 1, set thermostatted DC-DP pairs to be ~=0.01

Calculate dielectric constant from this:

Box size: constant
number of particles
polarizability: drude oscillators
does the mass matter, does the radius matter: we use lennard-jones interactions

M.Neumann:

epsilon - 1   4pi <M^2>
----------- = --- -------
epsilon + 2    3  3 Vk_bT

M is dipole squared

Make sure units are reasonable, cgs vs 

SI is maybe without 4pi/3

epsilon = 1 + chi, can solve for chi, and limit when M^2 is really small, our equation should reduce to that one

Convert from cgs to SI, and go through derivation of neumann paper 

Want to be looking specifically at toirodial boundary conditions
